A reference allele for fetub  was provided as a reference for removing non target alleles
No alleles from fetub were/was dropped because of being suspicious of not being target sequences

 fetub from BOR663 has more alleles for some samples than the expected ploidy. This can be caused by the co-amplification of other loci (eg. paralogues). Allele(s):

A reference allele for abcg8  was provided as a reference for removing non target alleles
No alleles from abcg8 were/was dropped because of being suspicious of not being target sequences

 abcg8 from BOR1143 has more alleles for some samples than the expected ploidy. This can be caused by the co-amplification of other loci (eg. paralogues). Allele(s):
