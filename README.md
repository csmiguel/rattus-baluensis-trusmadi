Effective population size associated with sky-island distribution in the summit rat, Rattus baluensis, a mountain Bornean endemic, *Journal of Heredity*, 2026, [https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esaf106](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esaf106)

We genotyped the sequencing data with [tidyGenR](https://github.com/csmiguel/tidyGenR), an R package developed for genotyping multilocus amplicons.
The full pipeline on how the genotypes were produced is found in [tidyGenR_benchmarking](https://csmiguel.github.io/tidyGenR_benchmarking).

The genotypes can be found in the Supplementary material and [here](output/genotypes_rbal_poly.rds).

Raw sequences are deposited in NCBI under the BioProject [PRJNA680166](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA680166).
